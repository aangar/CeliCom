this is the readme.
every time i make an update ill post it here. hopefully it doesnt break anything.
the last fully stable build is on 7/15, and that was with user functionality and all the goodies, plus the cart.

ADDED / WORKING ON:
-made the removal possible
    >make verification for if the item isnt in the cart, even for a request made.
-made the redirect to the cart, it just looks better overall
-checked for if an item was there, it wouldnt let you add it.
    >reasoning for this is that if this is point-to-point reselling, you wouldnt want it to add it again.
-just some general better looks and redirects, nothing to special for now.


CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS:
-check logic to ensure that the item is in the cart on removal, otherwise decide whats next
-once thats complete, check on Slack workspace for some ideas, or:
    >work on users making listings
        +verification
        +logged IN
        +time and date
        +all the goodies
